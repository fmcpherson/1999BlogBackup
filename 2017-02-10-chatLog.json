More copies of my content is backed up to local computers (a Mac and Windows 7 computer) using Dropbox sync.&nbsp;</p><p>The current configuration that I am using for this site is storing and serving the HTML files on the same server, which is not being backed up to any other device or server. If I were to use this a production system, I will want to have a copy of the content to at least one other site.</p><p>From what I read, I think Dave is pushing the content he writes in 1999 to his S3 bucket that hosts Scripting.com, which I think is the exact approach I would like to take. (Actually, I would prefer to make FargoPublisher work in that way, but if I hitch my ride to Dave's blogging tools I have to stick with where he is focusing is attention.)&nbsp;</p>",

Open River4, scan my reading list, and share items to Radio3. IFTTT takes all items from my Radio3 RSS feed and sends them to Pocket.</p><p>2. Open Nuzzel, scan through links shared by who I follow on Twitter, and send items I want to read to Pocket.</p><p>3. As time permits, read articles in Pocket. Tag items I want to aggregate to my <a href=\"http://tech2watch.info\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://tech2watch.info\">tech2watch.info</span></a>&nbsp;web site. Anything I want to write about, I open as a page and use a bookmarklet to send to Fargo where I then write something about the article.&nbsp;</p><h4>What I want:</h4><p>Ideally, I would like to integrate River4 and <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;and possibly eliminate the use of Pocket. How I think it would work:</p><p>1. The application has two tabs, a Read tab that shows the articles from all the web sites I follow, and a Write tab that shows the <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;site.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Each item in the Read tab has a button that I can click to read the full article. Ideally, the article expands in place in reader friendly manner that displays full content with no ads, as you can see in Pocket.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Each item in the Read tab has another button that I can click to share/write about the article, clicking that expands an input box like the one you see with on 1999.io, with the source link and article title pre-populated and space for me to write. I click the Post button and the item is added to my blog.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.: If memory serves me write, I think this is how Radio Userland worked. Link sharing was at the center of blogging in Radio Userland, rather than the story format that blogging seems to have evolved in to.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.S.: One more item to my wishlist, merge the <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;editor (I like the in place markup) with the Concord outliner for the blogging editor.&nbsp;</p>",

The result is everything that I write is now stored <a href=\"http://readwrite.club:1999/users/frankm/\">on my server</a> and <a href=\"http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/\">on S3</a>, providing me with the backup copy I desire.</p><p>The configuration also resolves <a href=\"http://notes.frankmcpherson.net/2016/04/14/testingNewBloggingSoftware.html\">a dependency that my Fargo blogs have on FargoPublisher to access what I write</a>. FargoPublisher is the web server for the Fargo blogs, using S3 as the file system for the server.&nbsp;</p><p>The consequence of this configuration is that my Fargo blogs require S3 and a server running publisher.js via nodejs in order for one to access my content. If the server hosting publisher.js goes down, you cannot access <a href=\"http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net\"><span data-href=\"http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net\" data-auto-link=\"true\">webnotes.frankmcpherson.net</span></a>&nbsp;even though the site hosting the content (S3) is still up.&nbsp;</p><p>By copying the content I write in <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-href=\"http://1999.io\" data-auto-link=\"true\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;to a S3 bucket and configuring that bucket for web hosting means that if my 1999 server goes down, the content will still be accessible. Amazon is much more capable of keeping S3 accessible than I am in keeping my servers running.&nbsp;</p><p>Best of all, keeping a web site running on S3 is a matter of paying the AWS bill each month, it doesn't require the ongoing administration that my Linux servers require.&nbsp;</p>",

And if I reply to you, how will you know it?&nbsp;</p><p>An original solution was the concept of a pingback, whereby blogging software would notice when someone linked to a post one wrote and then notified you when that event occurred.</p><p>WordPress now uses email. When you reply to a WordPress post, you usually see an option where you can tell WordPress to send you an email to you whenever someone replies to your reply, and/or if there are any changes to the post. Doing so requires subscribing to the post in WordPress, and while this method is effective, it is also cumbersome.&nbsp;</p><p>RIght now it feels that <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;is half way between the two, but the notification layer is missing. I can manually browse my posts in the editor and see replies, but requires me to constantly scroll through.&nbsp;</p><p>A solution may be to make a view of the editor in which the articles are automatically sorted in a way where those that have replies appear at the top. Or perhaps items with replies can be viewed in a separate tab. Either way, it seems to me there needs to be a way to surface items that have replies otherwise it will be very easy for them to be overlooked.&nbsp;</p><p>I also wonder whether there needs to be a provision for moderation and turning off replies so that you can manage SPAM. I turn moderation on all my WordPress sites because most of the replies are SPAM that I don't want actually published to the site.&nbsp;</p>",

Here are features/functions that I wish exist in 1999.io:</p><p></p><ul><li><span>A <b>bookmarklet</b> to easily insert links and quotes into a new blog post. I frequently use the bookmarklet for Fargo to quote someone. A bonus would be the simple support for linking to the source of the quote.</span></li><li><b>Markdown</b> support for formatting that would enable me to format text using mobile browsers. (Read <a href=\"http://readwrite.club:1999/users/frankm/2016/04/30/0035.html\">here</a> for more on my testing of <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a> with Android.) For me, mobile browser support is a main selling point versus Fargo. Fargo works in mobile browsers, but I find it works best in desktop browsers.&nbsp;</li><li><span>A <b>glossary</b>, which is a feature that Fargo and the OPML Editor had for saving snippets of frequently used text or links end easily insert them into your writing. The glossary for linking is similar to how a Wiki links to other pages, and I think this is a very useful feature for writers that is often overlooked.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>From <b>a hosting perspective</b>, what I like most is that it has been easy for me to automate the process of copying the HTML pages created by <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;to an Amazon S3 bucket that I can use to host my blog.&nbsp;</p><p>My main issue with how I have Fargo set up is that fargoPublisher needs to be running in order for my blog to be accessible, even though the HTML is stored in an S3 bucket. By default, the <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;node app serves HTML from the server's local storage, but it is easy to add a callback script to copy the HTML to S3. <a href=\"http://readwrite.club:1999/users/frankm/2016/05/06/0049.html\">This page</a> is served from my cloud server and <a href=\"http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2016/05/06/0049.html\">this page</a> is served from S3. The URL to the S3 site is the one I will promote when I share links.</p><p></p>",

            "text": "<p>I regularly use two tablets, a Nexus 9 and a Surface 3&nbsp;and I also own an iPad 3. We use the iPad primarily for watching streaming video, and the Nexus 9 is my primary reading and couch surfing device.&nbsp;</p><p>I've owned the original iPad, a Nexus 7 and an HTC tablet, so I have used tablets for a long time. Of all the tablets that I have used, the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-3\">Surface 3</a>\n has been the most useful.&nbsp;</p><p>The Surface 3 is flexible enough to meet a wide variety of use cases because it runs Windows 10 and a vast amount of desktop software. Consequently, the Surface 3 is valuable for both work and play.&nbsp;</p><p>Because it runs Windows 10, I can connect the Surface 3 to my company's email server and use Outlook. While I can also connect iPads and Android tablets to the same servers, you must use apps other than the version of Outlook that I regularly use. &nbsp;I can use it to access corporate intranet sites via a VPN and desktop web browsers.&nbsp;</p><p>My main use case for the Surface 3 is taking notes in <a href=\"https://www.onenote.com/\">OneNote </a>using <a href=\"http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pen/productID.325724000\">the Surface Pen</a>. The Surface's ten inch screen makes it nearly as large as a sheet of paper, so I find it very comfortable for writing.&nbsp;</p><p>I like writing notes by hand, and studies show that handwriting helps to retain information. By using OneNote I don't have to carry a bunch of paper, and I can quickly search for notes due to OneNote's ability to index digital ink.&nbsp;</p><p>One way the Surface 3 has been optimized for taking notes is that clicking the button at the top of the Surface Pen, like you would a ballpoint pen, launches OneNote. The process mimics how you would pick up a pad of paper and click a pen to write. Double-clicking the Surface Pen button captures a screenshot and saves it in OneNote to annotate.</p><p>If you own a Surface 3 <a href=\"https://realpersonalcomputing.com/2015/12/23/new-surface-pen/\">I recommend buying the new Surface Pen</a> because the new tips make for a very smooth writing experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge#rgHOOdtFAUmeid5w.97\">Edge </a>may be the best desktop web browser simply because it is really fast and renders pages beautifully. When I research information on the web, I can annotate a web page in digital ink and save a copy of that page in OneNote.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;10.52\" x 7.36\" x 0.34\" dimensions of the Surface 3 make it the perfect size for a productivity tablet. In my opinion 12 inches is too large for tablets because they are hard to use while just being held in your hands. You are not going to comfortably carry an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pro-4/productID.325711500?s_kwcid=AL!4249!3!102246747293!e!!g!!surface%20pro%204&amp;WT.mc_id=pointitsem+Google+Adwords+5+-+Surface+Pro+4%2F4+-+RLSA&amp;invsrc=search&amp;ef_id=L0JQO6BcQDkAAEO2:20160513194201:s\">Surface Pro</a> in ways that you can carry a Surface or iPad.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expected to like the size of the Surface 3, I didn't expect to find its built-in kickstand to be so useful. I prefer watching video on the Surface 3 rather than my iPad simply because I can stand it up in a good viewing position. I use the MLB At Bat, WatchESPN, and Netflix Windows Store (tablet) apps on the Surface 3.&nbsp;</p><p>Other Windows Store apps that I use regularly are Mail and Calendar, which come with Windows 10, MyRadar, and the MSN Apps: News, Money, Sports, and Weather. The Surface 3 came with an Office 365 subscription and full versions of Outlook, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2016, but I prefer using the Word and Excel mobile apps with their simpler UI.&nbsp;</p><p>As I wrote earlier, I am a heavy OneNote user, and because of that I use the Surface 3 as a tablet more than in \"notebook\" mode. I did buy the Type Cover, but if you walked by my desk you are likely to find the cover disconnected from the Surface 3 more than not.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-3-Type-Cover/productID.314885800\">Type Cover</a> is, in fact, the source of my main problem with the Surface 3. For some reason Windows 10 seems to forget that the cover exists. Some times I see USB errors, other times the keyboard just will not work. I am sure there is a Windows 10 driver issue, ironic given the problem is Microsoft hardware working with Microsoft software. The solution is to restart the tablet, which is quick enough to tolerate.&nbsp;</p><p>I occasionally have a similar issue with the Surface Pen; I will try writing on the tablet and nothing happens, the pen contact with the screen is not registered. Usually this problem is fixed by unscrewing the cap to disconnect the battery from the pen, which effectively resets the pen. Fortunately pen recognition issues happen much less frequently than the Type Cover issue.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time Microsoft released the Surface Pro 3, their were rumors that Microsoft was going to release <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9616596/microsoft-confirms-surface-mini-tablet-panos-panay\">a Surface Mini</a> that had a seven inch screen. Reports are that Satya Nadella cancelled the release of the Surface Mini on the belief it would not sell.&nbsp;</p><p>The Surface 3 may not literally be the Surface Mini, but for all practical purposes it is, and I think the 10.5 inch screen provides for more functionality than a seven inch screen would.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that the Surface 3 is now a year old, speculation will be whether Microsoft will release a Surface 4 and if they do what changes it may make. I imagine a Surface 4 could have a faster CPU, more memory, more storage, be thinner and lighter, but frankly, while all these would we welcome improvements I don't find them necessary.</p><p>In my opinion, the single biggest thing Microsoft could do to increase sales, beyond more marketing, is to lower the price so that one could buy the Surface 3, keyboard, and pen for no more than the $499 price they charge just for the tablet. Competing products from HP and Dell have such all-in one pricing, and frankly, if it had existed at the time I bought the Surface 3, I likely would have bought <a href=\"http://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/Laptops/spectre-x2-296008--1#!&amp;Tab=features\">the HP Spectre X2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom line, after a year of ownership, I am very happy with the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-3\">Surface 3</a>\n and it continues to be important part of my personal productivity toolkit. If you are looking for tablet to increase your productivity, I recommend you consider the 2-in-1s like the Surface 3.&nbsp;</p><p>[<a href=\"http://frank.frankmcpherson.net/disclosure.html\">Disclosure</a>]\n</p>",

If you are going to basically ignore comments (meaning that you aren't really going to spend time to see whether anyone has posted a comment) you may consider turning comments off. &nbsp;You do this in Settings, Access and uncheck the \"Allow anyone who is logged in to comment\" option.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to keep comments, I recommend thinking of your <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;editor page as a news feed. New comments will appear on this page and I think you will find them easier to find them here than in the rendered web site.

The app is also capable of detecting which app or web site you are using so that the proper one is displayed as an option for AutoFill or to copy your credentials for pasting on the login screen. When combined with a finger print scanner, the process of using LastPass to enter credentials on Android is fast and easy.</p><p>LastPass does not run in the background on iOS and therefore has no way to see whether you are in an app or web page that is prompting you for credentials. If you have to manually task switch or start the LastPass app, login to LastPass, copy the credentials (one at a time for userid and password), then manually paste on the login screen. While the process provides for access to your credentials, it is not nearly as easy or fast to use as with Android. </p><p>To be fair to iOS, the same issue occurs with Windows 10 store apps, although the LastPass Chrome extension runs on my Surface 3 and therefore detects and can autofill login credentials for web pages. </p><p>One will point out that iOS not allowing for apps to monitor what is displayed on your screen is a security and privacy feature, but one that in my opinion makes the mobile experience&nbsp;harder. LastPass requires I provide credentials to access the information I store in it, why shouldn't I be able to specify to iOS that I want it to monitor and prompt to provide quick access to my credentials? </p>",

Frankly, I think the reaction is a bit ridiculous. If you want the service to continue to be available, you have got to be willing to pay for it. Evernote is a critical part of my workflow and therefore I think it important to pay for the service to do my part to keep the service in existence. Why should you be entitled to a free service?&nbsp;</p><p>Some, <a href=\"https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/office-365/71633/evernote-price-hike-office-365-even-better-deal\">like Paul Thurrott</a>, will suggest Evernote users switch to OneNote, which is free. Frankly, I am skeptical that if a lot of users switched to OneNote that it will continue to be free. <a href=\"http://bgr.com/2016/04/25/onedrive-free-storage-limit-decreasing-july/\">The changes made with OneDrive</a> come to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>I use OneNote and Evernote. In fact, I have been using OneNote more now that I have a Surface 3. The two apps have different UI approaches, and I personally find OneNote's mobile UIs less appealing than Evernote's. Evernote's tagging and search functions are in my opinion easier and more powerful to use.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.onenote.com/import-evernote-to-onenote\">Microsoft does provide a free tool</a> to import notes from Evernote to OneNote, and I have considered using it to make a backup copy of my Evernote data. My fear, however, is that the import process will not work for me due to the amount of data I have and how much encryption I use in notes.&nbsp;</p><p>One alternative to Evernote that I have been keeping my eye on is <a href=\"https://turtl.it/\">an app called Turtl</a> because it by default encrypts its entire note database. The app is still in development and in beta and the developer has indicated plans to provide a premium service to cover its hosting costs. One benefit, however, is that there is a way to <a href=\"https://turtl.it/docs/server/\">host your own Turtl server</a>, which provides you complete control of your data but also adds responsibility to maintain that server and any backups.</p><p>If a service is not important to you, meaning that if it went away or your data was lost that would not be a big deal, then I see no problem using it for free. However, in my opinion, making a decision based on a service being free or not is the wrong approach if the service is important to you. Instead, you should determine the impact of losing your data and the features and functionality you want, and then consider what is a fair price of balancing that risk and value.&nbsp;</p>",

The next issue I had to resolve is that the site on the new server did not have the menubar from the original site. ~/nodestorage/publicFiles/users/frankm did not have a misc directory, which I created and then copied menubar.html, menubar.opml, and template.opml from the original server to the directory.&nbsp;</p><p>I did a quick update to my hello world post and the original menubar appeared along with the remainder of the content.</p><p>Next, I discovered that the archive pages were not generated when I republished the site, although they did exist on the S3 copy of the site.

Billed as bigger than <a href=\"https://blackfriday.com/pages/black-friday-history\">Black Friday</a>, last year I thought Prime Day was a dud, with no sales on products I was interested in. This year, however, was different. I bought a <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n for nearly $200 off. <br></p><p>I've been wearing the original Moto 360, which is now pretty old in gadget years. Motorola already sells version 2 of the Moto 360, and the original one will not get <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/index.html\">Android Wear 2.0</a> when it is released later this year. <br></p><p>Consequently, when I saw the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n for $200 and I confirmed it will get Android Wear 2.0 (in fact, it is one of two watches that can run the developer previews), I pulled the trigger. <br></p><p>The watch arrived this afternoon, and I am pleasantly surprised in how it looks and with the comfort of the band. I am a very hairy person, so I find the traditional \"linked\" metal watch bands uncomfortable because my hair gets caught in the links. This is the first time I've worn a watch with a mesh band, and so far, no pinches.</p><p>My own concern with the band is that it is not the easiest to put on, the standard buckle that comes with leather bands is much easier, so I may end up swapping the band. <br></p><p>I'll save my final verdict after using the watch for a few days to see whether the battery life can get through my day. I also hope that it can maintain connectivity with my <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php\">Nexus 6P</a>\n better than the Moto 360.<br></p>",

The key question to be answered is, does the watch have enough battery life to get through my day. I put the watch on at 9 AM, and at nearly two hours there is 91% battery life.</p><p>I am currently wearing the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\r\n configured for the screen to be on all the time, which is how you really need it in order to get the most use out of the watch. For example, right now I am using the Outlook watch face, which is connected to Outlook mobile on my phone and that is connected to my work Exchange server. The Outlook face provides me an at-a-glance overview of my meetings throughout the day, along with an indicator of how many unread messages are in my Inbox.&nbsp;</p><p>In dim mode the face shows the time, along with lines around the watch faces where meetings are scheduled, and unread message indicator. In full display I see the current date, the length of time until my next meeting and a snippet of the meeting subject.</p><p>The at-a-glance mode of the watch face is most useful when it is always on so I can just look down at it without having to touch the screen or even move my wrist.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Moto 360 this was called ambient mode, and I never used it because it caused drained the batter much too fast. For my testing of the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\r\n I figure I should start with the most extreme case to see how it works, and then ratchet down from there.</p><p>How good is the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\r\n?

I sleep in longer, am much more casual after waking up, so I usually don't take my watch off the charger until noon. Consequently, today's battery life is more about how it does on a weekend than the work week.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now at 8 PM the watch has 47% battery left. Android Wear says there is 8 hours of battery life left, while Wear Battery Stats says it has 4 hours left. I think Wear Battery Status is still learning about the battery life on the watch.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the cool features of the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n is that <a href=\"http://www.androidcentral.com/three-big-things-separate-moto-360-2015-huawei-watch\">it has an AMOLED screen</a>, which supports a low-powered, black and white, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/always-on.html\">always-on mode</a>. If you have a Moto X, it is the same type of display that allows it to always display the clock and notifications while the screen is locked. I am finding that always-on makes the watch much more functional.&nbsp;</p><p>Today I had my first \"glitch\" with the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n. &nbsp;Normally the watch automatically switches from full display to always-on, low powered display. I found this works with the built-in Android timer this evening when I was grilling.&nbsp;</p><p>I told Google to set a timer for 10 minutes, which the watch promptly implemented and shortly the screen switched to always-on mode with the timer displaying and updating. I thought this was cool, it enables me to quickly see how much time is left before I flip the chicken.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after the timer alarm went off and swipping to stop the \"alarm\" the screen stayed fully powered on and would no longer automatically switch to always-on mode, instead I had to manually initiate the change by pressing the crown.&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing cooking and eating dinner I restarted the watch and that resolved the always on display issue. It will be interesting to see whether this is a single occurrence or a bug with the timer app on the watch that prevents it from changing modes.&nbsp;</p>",

In short, I am very happy with this watch.</p><p>The main problem I had with <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_360_(1st_gen)-7682.php\">the original Moto 360</a> is its battery life. My benchmark for mobile device battery life is that I shouldn't have to worry about it, which means there needs to be battery life available until I go to bed at night.</p><p>Despite all the steps I took with the Moto 360 to preserve battery life, I just couldn't count on it to make it through an entire day. Worse is that to extend battery life as long as possible I had to not use many of the features of the watch.&nbsp;</p><p>Since day one, my <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n screen has been configured to be always-on. I've used interactive watch faces and tracked my steps using the active Google Fit step tracker, and I have not had to worry about battery life. Not once has the watch gone dead.&nbsp;</p><p>In my opinion, if your smartwatch screen is not always-on, whether in an ambient mode or full power, you are not getting full value from the watch. For example, I had configured the Moto 360 to not display unless I press the crown, which eliminates the glance-ability of the watch. One of the reasons to wear a smartwatch is to quickly see information without having to use a smartphone, tablet, or computer.&nbsp;</p><p>While I am on the topic of the display, let me say that the AMOLED screen on the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n is gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and text is very legible.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n seems thicker than the original Moto 360, but <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_watch-7687.php\">according to GSM Arena it is in fact 2 mm thinner</a>, and it has a smaller, 300 mAh battery compared to the 320 mAh battery in the Moto 360. I assumed the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n had a larger battery, so I am surprised to learn it does not.&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED\">AMOLED screen</a> is a reason for the Huawei Watch's battery life because it consumes much less power than other screen display technology.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Another problem I had with the Moto 360 is that it often lost connection with my <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php\">Nexus 6P</a>, and that might be a contributor to its poor battery life. I have not had similar problems with the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>, it maintains connection with the <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php\">Nexus 6P</a>\n throughout the day. The Huawei Watch supports Bluetooth LE 4.1 while the original Moto 360 supports LE 4.0, so that might be a factor with the connectivity&nbsp;difference.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Of course, a major difference between the two watches is that the Moto 360 is a first generation Android Wear watch, being one of the first ones sold starting in September 2014. The <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n is a second generation Android Wear watch that became available in September 2015, so Huawei&nbsp;benefited&nbsp;from learning about the problems with the first generation&nbsp;watches.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The key point here, I think, is that if you tried one of the first generation watches like the Moto 360 and were disappointed, I think it is worth checking out the newest watches as they are clearly better than the first ones. Given the discount price I payed for the <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch\">Huawei Watch</a>\n I am very pleased with this purchase and I have a more favorable view of Android Wear.&nbsp;</span></p>",

At first I was surprised at how comfortable the mesh band felt, but I started to have two issues. One is that I don't find it easy to put the band on my wrist, and second is that it isn't easy to tighten the band to the point so that it doesn't move.  </p><p>I ended up ordering a replacement band that arrived today. Replacing the band was easy thanks to Huawei's design that provides a quick release mechanism. The quick release mechanism makes it easy to swap watch bands without paying the high price for <a href=\"https://store.google.com/category/mode_watch_bands\">the MODE bands</a> Google sells. </p><p>Huawei's bands are even more expensive than the MODE bands, with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01789KR2Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&amp;coliid=I1RNQRNW6DQWHX&amp;psc=1\">the lowest price black leather band</a> costing $54.99. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01789KR2Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&amp;coliid=I1RNQRNW6DQWHX&amp;psc=1\">The mesh band costs $129</a>, suggesting that the band is about a third of the regular price of the watch! The black leather band that I bought on <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</span></a> cost $12.99 and is a nice, soft band.

It rebooted again, and now is installing a system update, which I assume is the firmware update.</p><p>The Surface 3 rebooted. All is well so far. After completing the update, my Surface 3 says that a driver update for the Intel HD Graphics was installed, and a System Firmware update from 8/8/2016 was installed.

First, when <b>will </b>people put the common good above their own self interests? Historically Americans have patted ourselves on the back for the peaceful transition of power that occurs when the result of a presidential election replaces one party with another in office. In some ways that did not happen when Obama took office, I would not characterize it as a peaceful transition of power.</p><p>Second, one thing we ought to learn from Trump's candidacy is that the process of electing presidents is changing. I think there are real consequences to the network affects the article describes. I couldn't agree more with the following:</p><p><i>\"If the Obama administration had more actively tended to that network, instead of subsuming it into the Democratic National Committee, his entire presidency might have played out differently.\"</i></p>",

Beyond the improvements in battery life, I don't think there is too much to be excited about in Nougat for existing smartphones and tablets. It looks to me like most of the improvements Google made are targeted at running Android apps on Chrome.&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom line, in my opinion, if you don't have a Nexus device to be one of the first to get Nougat, don't feel left out, there is little in it to be excited about.</p>",

It is a reminder of just how fragile the Internet is becoming because so much of it is built upon something someone else owns.</p><p>Imagine what will happen to the Internet if Jeff Bezos where to leave Amazon and the new leadership decided AWS was not core to their business. Amazon owns the hardware that hosts a good chunk of the Internet, and it would be their right to shut down that hardware almost at any time. Now, Amazon charges to use their hardware, so that provides some friction to it being shut down, but a lot of the Internet is built on free stuff for which there is little friction for its disappearance.</p><p>But, I digress...&nbsp;</p><p>1999 replaces the blogging functionality that the Fargo Publisher provides, and I've been doing my most recent writing in it, and Little Outliner replaces the outlining functionality that Fargo provides, so there is space and time for which to move.</p><p>As a user of Fargo, there are a few functions it provides me that are currently not provided by either 1999 or Little Outliner that I hope might be provided in some way in the future. Grouped in the two application areas, they are:</p><h4>Fargo to 1999</h4><p></p><ul><li><span>A linkblogging bookmarklet to quickly start a new blog post with a hyperlink to a source web page.</span></li></ul><p></p><h4>Fargo to Little Outliner</h4><p></p><ul><li><span>An Add Feed option (in Fargo, Outliner, Add Feed) for managing RSS subscription lists</span></li><li><span>The ability to encrypt outlines and read outlines encrypted in Fargo</span></li></ul><p></p><p>With Fargo it is real easy to add a new entry to a RSS subscription list, you just create a new node, write the name of the feed, click Outliner, Add Feed, paste in the URL to the feed, click OK and you are done. To do this with Little Outliner today requires adding/editing attributes that may not be familiar to the average end user. It might be that this can be duplicated by writing a script and selecting File, Run Selection but that requires learning some Javascript and figuring out how to manipulate attributes of a node in an outline. Perhaps adding Plugins to Little Outliner is the way to go?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, there are a couple of things Fargo provides that I like but are not in 1999, and I could live without but want to mention. One is the #stream type that organizes blog posts around dates. To me, journal-like writing such as linkblogging is best organized by date, where I can easily find what I wrote on a given date. The journal-like writing has been <a href=\"http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/\">how I have been using Fargo</a>, and in fact it is how I learned to blog using EditThisPage.&nbsp;</p><p>1999, while publishing content in reverse chronological order, uses Titles as the primary organizing method, as does almost all other blogging tools. For example, compare <a href=\"http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/2016/08/22/\">this link</a> that provides a days worth of short posts created in Fargo with <a href=\"http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2016/08/22/googleReleasesAndroid70.html\">this link</a> to a story (blog post) I created in 1999. Finding all that I wrote on a specific day with Fargo is very easy, finding all that I wrote on a specific day with 1999 takes more work. &nbsp;</p><p>I think what I would like is something like the monthly archive feature in 1999, which shows a month's worth of posts on one page, available for each day. It may be, however, that I am the only person who finds such a feature useful or likes to look back on what I wrote on a given day, and so I don't expect this to appear in 1999 but it is something that I will miss.</p><p>I will also miss the backgroundImage attribute that makes it real easy to put a background image on a blog post. For a while I was selecting an image for each day that I thought summarized the posts for the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I will miss the ability to use an outliner for writing blog posts. For me, while an input box is good for a two or three paragraph post, I prefer writing and editing longer stories in an outliner. Maybe some day Concord will appear as an editor option in 1999?&nbsp;</p>",

Fargo uses Dropbox for storage. In my opinion the announcement further supports my observation of the web's fragility in several ways. Many people rely on Dropbox's free cloud storage, and being free it could go away at any time.&nbsp;</p><p>Dropbox provides an Application Program Interface (API) that developers can use to write programs that communicate with Dropbox and read and write files stored in Dropbox. Dropbox freely supported this method for communications and apparently they have decided it costs them too much money to continue supporting, and so they have announced they will stop providing this interface. The consequence is that developers either need to find an alternative API or service, or do as Dave has done, and decide to stop supporting their applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, the paradox is that APIs are not bad, nor is Dave wrong for making the decision he has made. In Dave's case, he had been planning for the demise of Dropbox's API by developing nodestorage, and the difference between 1999 and Fargo Publisher reflects an evolution of thinking and in that process features are added and subtracted.&nbsp;</p><p>APIs are necessary to quickly develop new applications and services on the web by enabling one to building such services using prior work as building blocks. Using the Dropbox API meant that Dave did not have to create his own storage platform, and that enabled him to create Fargo as an independent developer. In fact, this is the story of how so many web apps can continue to be quickly made by small developers at very little financial expense.</p><p>The message is not that developers should not use APIs, but the story of Dropbox's API does highlight the risk in using any other entity's services. Consequently, the challenge is in determining the commitment of the entity providing the API over the long term.&nbsp;</p>",

Nexus phones are not truly Google phones. For example, the Nexus 6P is a Huawei phone and in fact you can order a Nexus 6P either <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/nexus_6p\">from Google</a> or <a href=\"http://www.gethuawei.com/nexus6p\">Huawei</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Pixel came into existence when Google announced, and later sold, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook_Pixel\">the original Chromebook Pixel</a>. The Chromebook Pixel was clearly Google hardware and it is not obvious who actually manufactures it. There is no partnership with Pixel products, they are sold as Google products although clearly manufactured by some other company.</p><p>If true, the new Pixel smartphones will be a little unique in that we appear to know who is manufacturing them for Google, reports are it is HTC. If the past is an indicator, the Pixel phones will be only sold on Google's store and will only have Google branding.&nbsp;</p><p>From the beginning, Nexus has been about partnership and leading the Android smartphone market. Part of that partnership was an attempt to influence how Android phones were developed. My guess is that originally Google hoped their hardware partners would decide to just use the \"stock\" Android software and updates and focus on hardware as a their competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, while they were able to work with several different Android smartphone manufacturers over the years, none of those manufacturers decided to transform all their products to stock Android. Worse, Samsung and others have articulated their desire to use other smartphone software and not rely on Google at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, I think Google has decided to give up on the idea that they could influence the smartphone market via the Nexus \"program.\" Instead, it appears they have decided they will sell smartphones are that are clearly Google phones (In a way returning to the original G1 branding) and in essence be competitors with the Android smartphone manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>",

I've been thinking about growth, and upon reflection on this conversation the title of Robert Fulghum's book, <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2399046-all-i-really-need-to-know-i-learned-in-kindergarten\">All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten</a></i>, came to mind.</p><p>I think the title states a truth about education in the United States, elementary grades (K thru 4th) are about growth, then you have a transitional period called either middle school or junior high (5th thru 8th grades), and then you have high school.&nbsp;</p><p>What we have in how education is commonly structured is a transition from growth to something else that is less about growth and more about indoctrination of an ideology that we believe prepares children for adulthood.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Originally, the ideology was citizenship, but I think that over time the ideology has shifted towards meritocracy. Today the focus is on preparing our children to be successful, and that success is defined within the context of capitalism.&nbsp;</p><p>We can debate whether or not this is a good thing, I have no doubt that a great deal of people believe this is exactly what schools and teachers should be doing. However, I don't believe this is growth.</p><p>Why does it matter?&nbsp;</p><p>It matters because too many people take the first six words of Fulghum's title literally, \"All I Really Need to Know....\" Too many people believe there is a time in their life at which they really do know all they need to know. The very structure of education teaches that there is a time in life when growth stops.</p><p>The consequence is that individual growth ends far too early in life. A great deal of society's problems is caused by people who stay within the first half of their life and don't continue growing, and with that there is no possibility for progress unless everyone else in the world conforms to your way of seeing.&nbsp;</p><p>To live is to grow, and growth only occurs when one realizes they will never know all they really need to know and that every day is an opportunity for their life to be transformed.&nbsp;</p>",

Why can’t the pastor wear jeans? Why can’t the pastor wear Converse? Seriously…why not?\"</blockquote><p>When Ruth and I were seeking a church, as the more \"experienced\" church goer I had more detailed requirements. I was raised Roman Catholic so my only church experience was liturgical, and so for a service to be \"church\" for me it had to fit with what I had most experienced.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Robes, cleric collars, and liturgy hold importance for some of us because they are an imprint of what is church, \"because we have always done it this way.\"&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Because we have always done it this way is very powerful because it gives us a sense of control, and what we most desire is being in control. I like my church just the way it is, thank you very much. Ironic, if you know the history of the Roman Catholic church and why it was assimilated by the Empire. Turns out, <a href=\"http://www.gotquestions.org/origin-Catholic-church.html\">Constantine was very insightful</a>. </p><p>So questioning why we do what we do is important, and not doing things simply because we have always done them is also important. But, I think equally wrong is to stop doing things simply to not, and I wonder whether not doing something for the sake of being welcoming is simply an excuse or a true reason. Are the decisions we make today really based on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jesus-doesnt-tweet/2015/04/30/fb07ef1a-ed01-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html?utm_term=.0bddc76b7efd\">what millennials want</a>, or are they based on what the generation in power (Gen X'ers) want? And, are our decisions based on a lack of appreciation for what came before, or truly formed by the Spirit in moving us forward? </p><p>The word we often interchange with \"because we have always done it this way\" is tradition. Generations before us separated Roman Catholics from Protestants along the lines of tradition (as implemented by <a href=\"http://people.howstuffworks.com/papacy1.htm\">papal authority</a>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura\">sola scripture</a>. What I find ironic is that most who hold the Bible alone (or are \"Bible believing\") don't seem to realize that they too are embracing tradition as the Bible is a record of tradition. Tradition was likely important to Jesus, who<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Christian-Needs-About-Jewishness-ebook/dp/B013XB2FWS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473902973&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rabbi+evan+moffic\">&nbsp;is a Jew</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;raised in a Jewish tradition, and yet we Christians tend to know so very little of Jewish tradition and thought. </p><p>American Christianity, in particular, tends to eschew tradition for the sake of defining Christianity within the context of an American capitalistic world view. Jesus was white, wants us to be financially successful (so that we can help others and have all that we want), and <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/09/09/national-anthem-flap-prompts-look-christian-take-patriotism/90120632/?sessionKey=&amp;autologin=\">would always stand during the national anthem</a>. After almost a century of all this, one has to ask, has American Christianity been successful? </p><p><a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2010/02/17/religion-among-the-millennials/\">The numbers</a>, as most church professionals know, are starting to say no. Might one of the reasons be that since the church has become so assimilated by society (see Constantine reference above) it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between the kingdom (society as we know it, or what most consider \"normal\") and the Kingdom of God? </p><p>Perhaps<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&amp;version=MSG\">&nbsp;doing things differently is not all bad</a>. Wearing robes and clerical collars are not the norm in society today, so what if that tradition is exactly what is needed?</p>",

One of the interesting things about this PC is that I think it was build for Mexico as the BIOS is in Spanish, it came with Spanish and English keyboards, and it's labeling is bi-lingual.&nbsp;</p><p>The computer has really been sitting around un-used but as part of cleaning up our basement, I finally got around to connecting it up and turning it on to see whether it still works. At the least I want to wipe the hard drive before giving the computer away.</p><p>It came with Windows Vista Home and while it booted, after logging in I would end up at a blank screen. Turns out, I actually have a copy of Windows Vista that I could have reinstalled, but I decided to see whether I could install Linux.</p><p>First, I installed Ubuntu LTS 16.04, which installed successfully but felt a little sluggish. While the computer is by no means current, it does have a dual core 2.8 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I searched on Google for the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=best%20linux%20distro%20for%20old%20computers\">best Linux distros for old computers</a> and read this article on <a href=\"http://www.tecmint.com/linux-distributions-for-old-computers/\">five distros for old computers</a>. I tried <a href=\"http://lxle.net/\">LXLE </a>and <a href=\"http://lubuntu.net/\">Lubuntu </a>and both had problems recognizing (of all things) the keyboard. I suspect the Spanish-language BIOS might have been an issue. I am a bit disappointed because they both look pretty good, but I really don't have the time or desire to work hard at trying to make either work.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I tried Mint. I installed <a href=\"http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3051\">Mint 18 Sarah Cinnamon Edition</a>, which specs align to the Pavilion and it installed successfully. Mind you, it's not really fast but is functional.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I need to decide whether I am keeping this computer, and if so, how to incorporate into my set up, they main problem being the monitor. I have an EliteDisplay S240ml with two HDMI and one VGA ports, but I use the VGA with my work laptop so unless I want to be constantly switching cables, I will need to see whether I can connect it to an HDMI port, which means getting a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VicTsing-Converter-Notebook-Computer-Projector/dp/B01F3J75G4/ref=dp_ob_title_wld\">VGA to HDMI converter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And how much money do I want to be spending on this old computer?&nbsp;</p>",

I wonder whether Google Assistant will replace Google Now on existing Android phones? <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/a/google-pixel-phone-new-hardware-interview-2016\">The Verge says</a> it is not replacing Google Now on Nexus any time soon. I guess Google is starting to act like typical hardware companies that hold back features to push one to upgrade.&nbsp;</p><p>For me the biggest issue with the Pixel phones is the price, $649 as the starting price of the 5-inch model and there is a $120 price increase for the 5.5-inch model, for a $769 total. This is much higher than the Nexus market has been paying. Is Google Assistant worth the price premium? Is the camera really good enough to justify the higher price? Pre-order now, ships October 20.&nbsp;</p><p>Google is still working on WiFi routers. The new hotness in WiFi is multiple access points to improve coverage in a home, which is an approach that has existed forever in enterprise implementations. As I see it, the biggest selling point of the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/google_wifi\">Google's new router </a>is the lower price to implement multiple access points.</p><p><a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/google_home\">Google Home</a> looks cool, but I already own an Amazon Echo and have a Dot ordered, so I am not sure I am willing to switch from that investment. I do like Google Home's integration with Chromecast. Design for multiple devices. $129 price is good, pre-order today, shipping on November 4.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be really, really cool is if Echo could control Chromecast. Here in lies the single biggest problem with IoT, it is all about lock in. I have three different IoT hubs (Hue Bridge, SmartThings, and Logitech Harmony) while there should be one \"generic\" hub that can control multiple brands of devices.</p><p>(BTW, I thought Google changed the branding of Chromecast to Google Cast, what happened?)</p><p>I fear Google Home may be too late. People who have bought in to smart homes have likely already invested in Echo, and the size of the \"intelligent assistant appliance\" market is a big unknown. A great number of people are not comfortable with an always on, always listening device in their home.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the hardware devices Google announced, the one with the most appeal is the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_ultra\">Chromecast Ultra</a>. But here too, there is the problem that I already have a Chromecast on all the TVs and a monitor in my house. The second generation Chromecast works just fine on my 4K Samsung TV, and I have yet to encounter 4K content that compells me to switch out for the Ultra.&nbsp;</p><p>The rumors were wrong about tablets, Google did not announce a new tablet to replace the Nexus 7 that was so popular. We also didn't hear anything about a new operating system from Google.&nbsp;</p>",

Yet, email is the most commonly used and therefore most important communication tool because it is not app-specific. One can use a number of different apps to access email, and more importantly, the person with whom you exchange email does not need to use the same app as you, and this is a fundamental difference between all the other services except for SMS text messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases to use Slack, WhatsApp, Skype, or Facebook Messenger, all parties involved in the communication have to use those same apps and that is a big hurdle. It is why Facebook is firmly entrenched, enough of your friends are there to keep you using it despite how much you hate it.</p><p>In other words, for something to replace email it has to be a server-based solution open for access to a wide range of different apps to increase the probability a person's app of choice works. Unfortunately, technology is much more siloed today than ever before and consequently email will remain one of the sole common denominators. (If Apple were serious about iMessage, it would have gone ahead and made it open to work with other apps on other platforms, or at least created an Android version of iMessage. Instead, Apple treats iMessage as a carrot to lure more people to iOS, which means iMessage has no chance of replacing email.)&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, we are left with email and therefore any hope for improving email lies in alternative email apps rather than replacing email \"the service.\" We are starting to see apps adding AI and other features that hopefully make it easier to quickly review and process email. &nbsp;</p><p>I find myself to be in the minority in liking <a href=\"https://www.google.com/inbox/\">Google's Inbox app</a>, most people stick with the \"standard\" Gmail. I like how Inbox bundles emails and provides a quick way for me to scan and archive them as a bundle rather than individually, which enables me to process email faster. Google also recently added a suggested replies feature that speeds up sending replies to messages.</p><p>Other companies continue to work on creating a better email app.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notion.ai/\">Notion</a> is a new one that I just learned about, and it is the first email app that I have seen that claims to add AI. I am going to try it out to see how well it works and whether it works better than Inbox.&nbsp;</p>",

It is one of my favorite pieces that I have written and so I am re-publishing it here for preservation.&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p>Si Quaeris Peninsulam Amoenam Circumspice, if you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you, is the motto of the state of Michigan. At no time of the year is that motto more true than in autumn.</p><p>As a life long resident of Michigan, I have grown to appreciate the changing weather for which the state is known. I love sunshine and warmth as much as anyone, but continued days of the same blue sky, sun, and heat does not seem right to my Michigan-trained senses.</p><p>Of the four seasons, autumn is the one that I most equate to my home town and the Upper Peninsula. I know that for some, autumn brings with it depression both real and imagined as it preludes winter, but for me the changing colors of leaves, the crisp, cool air, and the smells transport me back to a younger, less complicated time in my life.</p><p>Excitement for a new school year and seeing friends again, football, marching band practices, bomb fires, camp fires, walks through the woods, leaf piles, and jumping into leaf piles. </p><p>As the temperatures creep slowly towards freezing, the fall leaves stiffen and walking through them produces a distinct crunch. While spring has its delightful fragrances and beauty, autumn engages all the senses, sight, sound, smell, and with hot apple cider and donuts, yes, even taste. </p><p>The smell is what to me sets autumn apart from all other times of the year. It's as if as each amber and red leaf tumbles towards the ground, its fragrance is released into the air. </p><p>Are you struggling to remember long past and perhaps happier times? If you are fortunate enough like me to have grown up in and currently in the U.P. or anywhere else that has the signs of fall, go outside right now, close your eyes and inhale deeply. Listen to the sounds around and let the winds bring back the smile to your face.</p>",

The immediate aftermath will be the punditry on why Trump has been elected.&nbsp;</p><p>I hoped this wouldn't happen, but deep down in the pit of my stomach I knew it would happen. One place to look to why this happened are the favorability ratings of <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/poll-congress-approval-rating-gop-leadership-121285\">Congress</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ratings show that many people think our representatives do a bad job. When they looked at Trump, they probably think, he can't be any worse than what we already have, so why not try something different?</p><p>Obviously, this same analysis took place in comparing Clinton and Trump. Many people feel <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/\">they are equally bad</a>. When selecting between two bad options, they chose the different option, or the devil you don't know versus the devil you do know.</p><p>In the advertising I saw here in Michigan, the ads from Trump and Clinton made these options very clear. Trump's ads positioned him as the outsider and a vote for him is a vote for change, Clinton's ads positioned her as the safe, known, reliable, and translated by many as non-change, option.</p><p>So, to me, the main message of Trump's election is that nearly half country wants change, no matter what. I am pretty sure not everyone agrees with all the changes Trump proposed during his campaign, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-agenda.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur\">I bet many people hope many were empty promises</a>, but they don't care!&nbsp;</p><p>No one can dispute that Trump is very different from any person we elected President. What I will dispute, and which I fear not enough people have fully considered, is that the consequences of that difference could really be worse than what is already in place.&nbsp;</p><p>But hey, today a lot of people are satisfied in the fact that they \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ashgP4YMdJw\">stuck it to</a>\" whoever and whatever they have a problem with.&nbsp;</p>",

What the heck is going in the FBI? Depending on whether you are Republican or Democrat you probably think either the FBI is not doing their job in pursuing an obviously guilty person (Hillary), OR you think the FBI attempted, and perhaps succeeded, in influencing the election. Either way, the integrity of the FBI is now in doubt.</p><p>2. The facts are someone or some entity hacked into <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-hack-u-s-politics-bigger-disclosed-includes-gop-n661866\">the DNC and the GOP</a> and the DNC emails were published on the Internet. Why? If Russia is hacking in to the political parties I doubt it is just for the LOLs. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-campaign-moscow-russia-contacts-231168\">If Russia favored Trump</a>, why? Who stands to gain? &nbsp;And why does it seem as though Trump won't even consider Russia is behind the hacking? If you truly are concerned about corruption in government, you want to know the answer, which brings me to...</p><p>3. Why should we trust the FBI, which is the only investigative arm of the federal government, to actually get to &nbsp;and expose the truth? Who is going to investigate the investigators?&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part1.html\">A functioning press</a>, fulfilling its role in our government would provide part of the answer. Unfortunately, the press has too often demonstrated, such as during the run up to the Iraq War, the ability to be distracted by the sensational that increases profits rather in truth telling. Oh, and keep in mind how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">the government actively pursues whistleblowers</a>, no doubt to protect against the likes of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part4.html\">Deep Throat</a>.</p><p>The story here could be on the scale of Watergate. Heck, it is a repeat of Watergate in that back then DNC offices were broken in to and the Nixon administration attempted to cover up their role in the break in. Hacking is the modern day form of breaking and entering. Back then the press exposed corruption in government, could today's press even notice such a thing were happening?&nbsp;</p>",

His answer was: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"&nbsp;</i></blockquote><p>I listened to <a href=\"http://pca.st/xjT0\">the MSNBC Morning Joe podcast</a> this morning in which&nbsp;Joe Scarborough says (paraphrasing): \"Don't worry, it isn't as bad as you are fearing, our constitutional republic will survive.\"&nbsp;</p><p>First, I don't think we should take anything for granted. There are things our constitutional republic cannot overcome, there is nothing written in stone that guarantees the republic will stand.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the people in our government chose to not live to the spirit of their oath to uphold and defend the constitution, I &nbsp;believe the republic can fall.</p><p>And here in lies my problem. Scarborough is asking me to <b>trust </b>Congress and trust the Supreme Court to fulfill their obligations as the checks and balances against the Executive Branch.&nbsp;</p><p>The key word here is <b>trust</b>. Trust is something earned, and frankly nothing that Congress and the Supreme Court has done in the last four years has earned my trust.&nbsp;</p><p>In my eyes, time and again over the last four years the Republican-led Congress has put party over country. They refused to govern, passed hardly any legislation, and would not compromise on anything. From being willing to default on our loans to refusing to even have hearings on the next Supreme Court justice.&nbsp;</p><p>Time and again during Trump's campaign, Ryan and McConnell have had opportunities to stand up to their party's nominee and put country before party, and time and again they refused. Are we to believe now, with a Republican in the White House, they are suddenly going to stand up to him when he proposes something unconstitutional or not consistent with our values?&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly, my worry is less with Trump and more with Congress. I want to believe that the checks and balances instituted by the Constitution will in fact protect us, but I am honestly afraid they will not.&nbsp;</p><p>And here in lies the threat to the republic. When citizens lose faith in the very fundamentals of our government they begin to think it might as well be replaced, it simply represents business as usual that is causing them pain.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not enough to simply tell people to not worry. It's not enough to tell people you will be faithful to your oath. You must walk the talk. You must demonstrate that there is in fact a line no one, no matter which party, can cross.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know Congress' line. I don't know the Supreme Court's line, I thought it was non-partisan but that is demonstrably false. My hope is that I know the military's line.&nbsp;</p>",

They don't agree with all the things Trump has said or claims he will do, but the end, of making \"America Great Again,\" justifies overlooking the means.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that the above assumes a common definition for what makes America Great, and I think that is problematic because I expect each of Trump's constituencies has a different definition for a Great America based on their world view.&nbsp;</p><p>For many Christians, the end they desire is the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, which they hope at a minimum decreases abortions if not completely eliminating it. In other words a Great America is a country in which there are no abortions, and that end justifies tolerating all of the issues they may otherwise have with Trump.

I have been using <a href=\"http://Fargo.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://Fargo.io\">Fargo.io</span></a>&nbsp;to write, but that is going away in June so I have to find another tool.&nbsp;</p><p>I really like using an outliner to write long articles, so I wish that I could use <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com\">Little Outliner</a>, but there is no way to get stuff out of it. Little Outliner creates OPML files that I need converted to HTML to use with Wordpress.&nbsp;</p><p>When I use Fargo, I run a script that exports an outline to HTML with paragraphs. Unfortunately, Little Outliner does not support scripts in the same manner as Fargo so I cannot simply re-use that one.</p><p>An option is to go back to Evernote. Many years ago, when I was writing for money, I used Evernote to write all my articles that were ultimately pubished in WordPress. I came up with a notation to use to handle formatting and hyperlinks, but unfortunately the process required some manual re-editing after I copied and pasted the article content from Evernote to Wordpress.&nbsp;</p><p>The advantage of using Evernote is that it provides a repository for all my writing and there are apps available for it on every platform I use.&nbsp;</p><p>One way I could simplify the process is to use markdown as I am writing in Evernote. I have found that I can enable markdown in Wordpress and it looks <a href=\"https://fjmnotes.com/2016/12/21/testing-markdown/\">it will accept most formatting directly</a> with out any post paste editing.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if only the 1999 editor supported markdown directly. I think there is a way to add alternative editors, I need to do more search about that.</p>",

The stylus support in OneNote on the Surface is one of the best that I have ever used.</p><p>I am among the minority of people who like using a stylus, and so my increase use of the iPad Mini 4 sent me on a search for a stylus that I can use with the Mini. Today received the <a href=\"http://wacom.com/en-us/products/stylus/bamboo-fineline\">Wacom Bamboo Fineline</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Regular iPads do not have a built-in digitizer, so you cannot use the same type of stylus as with the Surface. (I am not sure whether the iPad Pro has a digitizer.) Instead, iPad styluses come in two type, one that has a wide tip that mimics a finger, and the other that has a fine tip, like a pen, that uses Bluetooth, and the Fineline falls in this later category.</p><p>Wacom's set up instructions tell you to enable Bluetooth on your iPad, which is expected, and to disable multitask gestures, which may not be expected. You need to turn of multitask gestures so that apps can implement palm rejection to not create stray marks from the palm of your hand touching the screen while you write.&nbsp;</p><p>Another unique step is that you don't actually pair the stylus with your iPad, rather, you pair the stylus with the apps that use the stylus, and that means you need to use apps that specifically support the Fineline. Wacom lists <a href=\"http://wacom.com/en-us/getting-started/bamboo-fineline\">nine apps</a> that have support for their stylus, but unfortunately that does not include Evernote or OneNote. Evernote only supports a stylus made by Adonit while OneNote doesn't really support a stylus on the iPad, it seems to expect writing with a finger.</p><p>I decided to buy <a href=\"http://www.goodnotesapp.com/\">GoodNotes</a>, which had good reviews and includes the ability to import PDFs for annotation. I've only tried the app briefly, but it has the ability to backup notes to cloud services like Google Drive and I can export note pages to Evernote. I wish Evernote directly supported the Wacom stylus, but I don't expect to write copious notes on the Mini, so I think being able to export PDFs or images of my notes will be good enough.</p>",

            "text": "<p>In preparation for a podcast that I will participate in this weekend, I am thinking about my experience with <a href=\"https://madeby.google.com/home/\">Google Home</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I am early adopter of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E\">Amazon Echo</a>, which I use to control my <a href=\"http://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-li/hue-personal-wireless-lighting\">Hue lights</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smartthings.com/\">SmartThings</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/harmony-hub\">Harmony Hub</a>. We have an Echo in my home office (the basement), and a Dot in our living room.&nbsp;</p><p>Google Home does not have much that is better than Echo, which isn't too surprising given Amazon's year+ lead over Google. Home excels in Internet search, as you would expect, so it is a bit better for finding general information.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way that Home is better than Echo is its ability to control <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chromecast/?utm_source=chromecast.com\">Google Chromecast</a>. First, Home automatically finds Chromecast devices on your home network, whereas you need to explicitly set up other home automation devices like Hue and SmartThings.</p><p>Once you get Home connected on your network, you can say things like, \"Ok Google, show pictures on basement TV\" and Home will start a slideshow of your Google Photos on the Chromecast called basement TV. You do need to have the Chromecast running on a TV before seeing the pictures, Home will not turn on your TV unless you have it integrated with other home automation devices.</p><p>The speaker built-in to Google Home is slightly better than the one in Echo, but both are pretty good. Neither are as good as the Yamaha soundbar I have connected to my Samsung TV, so I enjoy telling Google to play my favorite music on my Basement TV Chromecast, which of course sends audio to the soundbar.&nbsp;</p><p>I have Google Home and Echo connected to my Spotify account. Of course Echo plays music from Amazon Prime as well as any music that you own and associated to your account. Google Home also plays music from Google Play, where I happen to have uploaded all of my personal music that I ripped from CDs over the years.</p><p>Home also is integrated with Netflix, so you can say \"Hey Google, play Supergirl on basement TV\" and it will start streaming via Chromecast to your TV. I can configure Echo to turn on Netflix via the Harmony hub, but I cannot direct it to a specific show, although I can tell Harmony to turn on specific cable TV channels via Harmony.</p><p>Alexa, which is the brains behind Echo, has a ton of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13727921011\">skills that add functions</a>, ranging from the silly, like telling jokes, to requesting an Uber. Amazon has a pretty good developer network and seems to be releasing new skills for Alexa every week.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/15/google-just-added-ton-new-services-google-home-wont-care/\">Home has services</a> that add functions, but only a few are currently available. Most services are basically a form of a web search but there are services like Uber, Todoist, and Kayak that provide specific functions.&nbsp;</p><p>Echo and Home both work with <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/discover\">If This Then That</a>, so you can use them to trigger applets that work with other smart home devices or web services. I am surprised that there is no real integration between Android and Google Home, but you can add it with <a href=\"https://tasker.dinglisch.net/\">Tasker</a> and <a href=\"https://joaoapps.com/autovoice/\">AutoVoice</a>, which are automation tools for Android.</p><p>Google Assistant is the brains behind Home in the same way that Alexa is the brains of the Echo and Dot. Assistant is also available on the Google Pixel phones, while Google Now is a similar, but not the same, assistant on all other Android devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Google Home ought to be able to recognize Android devices just like it does Chromecast, and likewise Android should know about Home. Here is a an example of where the lack of integration causes a problem.</p><p>I have Google Now configured on my Nexus 6 P to wake up whenever I say \"Ok Google\" even while I have the phone turned off. &nbsp;When I am in my basement and say \"Ok Google\" both Home and my phone acknowledge the wake word. The phone should recognize there is a Home nearby and defer to it, just as it does with Android Wear, but it does not.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more maddening is the integration with <a href=\"https://keep.google.com/\">Keep</a>, Google's notetaking and list making app. Home/Google Assistant creates a item in Keep called Google Assistant shopping list, and you call say \"Ok Google, add milk to shopping list\" and Home will add milk to that shopping list note.&nbsp;</p><p>Say \"Ok Google, add bread to shopping list\" to your Android phone and it will add bread as an item to another entry in Keep called Shopping List, which means you end up with two shopping list areas in Google Keep, one controlled by Assistant/Home and the other controlled by Google Now. How hard would it be for Assistant to add items to the Shopping List entry that Google Now uses?&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and by the way, Echo also has a shopping list that is of course directly connected to Amazon so Alexa can automatically order stuff on that list, where as the Google's shopping list is more traditional.</p><p>The duplicate shopping list scenario is the type of thing we see with first generation products like Google Home. I expect Google Home to get much better as Google improves Assistant, which I think will ultimately replace the Google Search web page. In the mean time we will have to wait and see whether Google Home will surpass Amazon Echo.&nbsp;</p>",
